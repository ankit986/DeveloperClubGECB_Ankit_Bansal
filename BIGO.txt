BIG O - ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS

1. Language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run.(efficiency of an algorithm)
2. Focus on what basically happening.



i.e. n

1. ""How quickly runtime grows"" - It's hard to pin down the exact runtime of an algorithm. It depends on the speed of the processor, what else the computer is running, etc. So instead of talking about the runtime directly, we use big O notation to talk about how quickly the runtime grows. 

2. Relative to input -	If we were measuring our runtime directly, we could express our speed in seconds. Since we're measuring how quickly our runtime grows, we need to express our speed in terms of...something else. With Big O notation, we use the size of the input, which we call "n" So we can say things like the runtime grows "on the order of the size of the input" (O(n)) or "on the order of the square of the size of the input" (O(n^2)). 

3. As input gets large - Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when n is small but are adapted eventually by other steps as n gets huge. For big O analysis, we care most about the stuff that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly adapted as n gets very large. (If you know what an asymptote is, you might see why "big O analysis" is sometimes called "asymptotic analysis.") 


big O hamara runtime nahi batata ye batata hai ki how  quickly our algorithm grows
